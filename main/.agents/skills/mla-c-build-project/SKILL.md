# Build and Run Instructions

This project uses **CMake** as its primary build system. Native platform builds are supported on Linux, Windows, and WebAssembly.

## Prerequisites

- CMake (version 3.25 or higher)
- A C++11 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A build generator (e.g., Ninja or Make)

## Compiler Compatibility

To maintain the portability of the MLA framework, the codebase must remain strictly compatible with all supported compiler toolchains across different platforms:

- **Linux:**
  - **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection)
  - **Clang** (LLVM Clang compiler)
  - **Fil-C** (Memory-safe C/C++ compiler, `filcc`/`filcpp`)
  - **Zig** (Zig compiler in C/C++ mode)
- **Windows:**
  - **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++ compiler)
  - **Clang** (LLVM on Windows)
  - **Zig** (Zig compiler on Windows)
- **WebAssembly (WASM):**
  - **Emscripten** (`emcc`/`em++`)

Code changes must not use compiler-specific or non-standard features unless they are properly guarded behind platform/compiler macros, ensuring clean compilation across all of the above tools.

## Building the Project Natively

To build the test suites and example applications natively:

1. **Configure the build directory:**
   Using Ninja (recommended):
   ```bash
   cmake -G Ninja -B build
   ```
   Or using standard Makefiles:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build
   ```

2. **Compile all targets:**
   ```bash
   cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
   ```

### Major Build Targets

> [!NOTE]
> The actual build target names might differ depending on the parent repository or project configuration.

Depending on your platform, CMake generates the following targets:
- `MLA_C_Test_Linux_Single_Thread`: Linux unit/integration tests running in single-threaded mode.
- `MLA_C_Test_Linux_Multi_Thread`: Linux unit/integration tests running in multi-threaded mode.
- `MLA_C_App_Linux`: Example application demonstrating framework features on Linux.
- `MLA_C_Test_Windows_Single_Thread` / `MLA_C_Test_Windows_Multi_Thread`: Windows test suites.
- `MLA_C_App_Windows`: Windows example application (D2D/OpenGL).
- `MLA_C_Test_WASM_Single_Thread`: WebAssembly test suite via Emscripten.

## Running Tests

To run individual test suites, invoke the corresponding test binary with the `--test` flag:

```bash
./build/gcc/MLA_C_Test_Linux_Single_Thread --test
```

To run all tests across all compiled compiler configurations automatically, use the provided helper script:

```bash
./run_all_tests.sh
```

You can also run tests for a specific compiler configuration by passing its name:

```bash
./run_all_tests.sh gcc
```

---

## Running Benchmarks

To run individual micro-benchmarks, invoke the test binary with the `--benchmark` flag:

```bash
./build/gcc/MLA_C_Test_Linux_Single_Thread --benchmark
```

By default, this will run all registered benchmarks and print the timing results to the console.

> [!WARNING]
> Benchmarks are slow and can take several minutes to run, especially for all configurations.

To run all benchmarks across all compiled compiler configurations automatically, use the helper script:

```bash
./run_all_benchmarks.sh
```

You can also run benchmarks for a specific compiler configuration by passing its name:

```bash
./run_all_benchmarks.sh gcc
```

---

## Common Configurations

All build and runner scripts share a common configuration file:

- `configs.sh` (defines `BUILD_CONFIGS` and `RUN_SUITES`)

The core execution logic is separated and stored within the base library tools folder:

- [build_all_impl.sh](file:///workspace/lib/base-lib/build/tools/build_all_impl.sh)
- [run_tests_impl.sh](file:///workspace/lib/base-lib/build/tools/run_tests_impl.sh)
- [run_benchmarks_impl.sh](file:///workspace/lib/base-lib/build/tools/run_benchmarks_impl.sh)

The root scripts (`build_all.sh`, `run_all_tests.sh`, and `run_all_benchmarks.sh`) act as clean entry points that configure the environment by sourcing `configs.sh` and then delegate execution to the implementation scripts.

---

## Static Analysis (Clang-Tidy)

Clang-tidy is integrated into the build system and enabled by default (`MLA_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=ON`). It automatically analyzes code during compilation using the config in `lib/base-lib/build/.clang-tidy`.

To disable clang-tidy for faster builds:
```bash
cmake -DMLA_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF -B build
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Never commit build artifacts** (always use `build/` directory which is gitignored).
2. **Never check in custom binary files or main templates.**
3. Verify that all tests pass locally before proposing changes.
